## Text Styling
Here's some *italicized* text, some **bold** text, some ~~struckthrough~~ text. 
This is a subscript: a<sub>b</sub>.
And, this is a superscript: a<sup>b</sup>.
## Quoting
My favorite recent project has been [an interpreter for the esolang Brainf**k.](https://github.com/mrtonbrian/BrainSomethingInterpreter) Surprisingly, GitHub supports it as a markdown highlighting syntax. Here is what "Hello World" looks like:
```bf
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
```
A pretty good quote for programmers is:
> "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight." - (Bill Gates)
